1. What am I struggling with so far in the boot camp? What do I feel successful at? 
    - I am currently struggling on understanding how to use React. Every time I try to implement something that I learned from previous lectures, the code ends up breaking. That's also due to the fact that React does not work the same. I feel like I'm kind of starting all over again. 
2. What can I do in this unit to get my closer to my career goals? 
    - Create more React projects without the guides. Read up on React.
3. What am I most proud of so far in this boot camp?
    - Before I struggled with sending questions in to HelpDesk and now I find myself doing it more and more. I'm pretty proud of myself for asking for help instead of letting myself stress over a problem. 
4. How am I spending my work time? Can I do anything to improve my productivity? 
    - I try to tell myself that if I can't finish the problem within 15 minutes (this includes googling and implementing code that I think might work), then to ask my classmates. If they don't know the answer, then I ask the instructors. Also I ask my classmates to lead me to the answer.
5. What did I learn from this workshop that I can use when searching for jobs or communicating with potential employers?
    - 
6. What aspects of the last unit can I add to my resume? What are my strengths from that unit?
